# Practical-Machine-Learning
The goal of this project is to create a model that predicts the manner in which an exercise was performed based on data from sensors placed on the body of participants and equipment while the exercise was being performed. The manner in which the exercise was performed is classified into five groups. One group representing the exercise performed correctly and the other four groups representing different types of errors. We have chosen a **Generalized Boosted regression model** (gbm) because tree based models are good at classification, and with the addition of boosting we increase the accuracy while lowering the variance of the final model.
